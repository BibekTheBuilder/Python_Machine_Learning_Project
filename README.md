# Python_Machine_Learning_Project
We conducted an extensive analysis using four different machine learning models to explore the potential differences in their performance. Our analysis took into account various factors, including the model's architecture, hyperparameter settings, regularization methods, and noise robustness, which could contribute to variations in their predictions. To assess the performance of these models, we employed K-fold cross-validation with both 5 and 10 folds. Throughout the analysis, we utilized popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy for data analysis, along with matplotlib for visualizations. The results revealed that the models exhibited varying scores across different fold settings, indicating a slight variations in their performance.
